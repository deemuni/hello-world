# hello-world
This repository is a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

Hello everyone,

My name is Dipti, which is pronounced Deep-thi. Some people call me Dee. I love chocolate, art, nature, tech, coding, socializing and numbers. Just getting started with Github. Pretty excited. I will soon post my projects here. Also, I would like to collaborate with other people to do awesome projects. 

Happy Coding!

Dipti (Dee)
